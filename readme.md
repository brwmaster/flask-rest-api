# Flask rest API

This is a simple rest api build with Flask.
For now there are not test and the code needs to be improved with error handling etc ...

Also keep in mind that a DB will be added alongside authentication in the future

This Project is mainly for me to learn about Python and Flask and how to build rest api's with it.
